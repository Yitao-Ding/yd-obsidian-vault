# Launch HN: Agnost AI (YC S26) – Extract user feedback from agent conversations

> https://agnost.ai

## 要約 (日本語5行)

Agnost AI は、チャット/音声エージェント会話から隠れたユーザーニーズと失敗パターンを自動抽出するプロダクト分析ツールです。
Rageprompting、言い直し、訂正などの行動的シグナルをクラスタリングして、従来の metrics では見えないユーザー満足度を可視化します。
従来の observability は技術的な visibility (遅延、エラー) のみを提供し、evals は既知のケースを検証するのに対し、Agnost は discovery に特化しています。
ClickHouse 上の最適化されたスキーマで数百万メッセージを LLM に送らずに分析し、動的にクラスタを生成・分割して新しい評価項目を提示します。
YouTube 字幕エディタの事例で、70ユーザーの隠れた「自動字幕」要望を 12 パターンの言い回しから発見し、実装に至った実績があります。

## 原文 (Abstract)

Hey HN, we’re Shubham &amp; Parth, childhood friends building Agnost AI (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;agnost.ai">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;agnost.ai</a>), product analytics for teams building chat and voice agents.<p>We read production conversations and find behavioral failures like users rageprompting (cursing at the agent), repeatedly rephrasing the same request, correcting the agent, asking for missing features, or leaving after an answer that was technically successful.<p>We have an interactive demo with no signup here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.agnost.ai?demo=true">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.agnost.ai?demo=true</a><p>Here&#x27;s a demo video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tella.tv&#x2F;video&#x2F;agnost-ai-launch-hn-demo-9haa" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tella.tv&#x2F;video&#x2F;agnost-ai-launch-hn-demo-9haa</a><p>The core problem is that chat and voice products do not have the same metrics as web apps. When the product interface is language, clicks and funnels become much less useful. Users also rarely give explicit feedback, and when they do it&#x27;s usually sugarcoated. I barely type &#x2F;feedback in Claude or Codex myself. Most users just curse, ask again, correct the agent, or leave. So product engineers get technical visibility from latency, errors, and traces, but still have to guess whether users got what they wanted.<p>We got here after building around agents for the last year and got a couple of founders asking for something like a PostHog for conversations for the AI assistants they were building.<p>We are not trying to be in the observability or evals space. Observability tells you what happened technically. Evals validate cases you already know. We&#x27;re more on the discovery side like what users wanted, where they got frustrated, what they asked for repeatedly, and what new evals should exist.<p>Teams send us agent conversation messages through SDKs or OTel, optionally with metadata like account, plan, source, organization, etc. We cluster conversations into product-specific intents. Feature requests and bugs are default categories; most other clusters are created dynamically from the customer’s data and evolve over time. You can create your own cluster in plain English. If a cluster gets too broad, we split it. If a new pattern appears, we suggest it.<p>One AI video editor company used Agnost AI to find feature requests hidden inside chat. The biggest one was that around 70 users wanted auto-subtitles, but users said it as “add this text in this frame” 12x in a single session, “can you caption it”, “give me transcript of audio” and variations across languages. The team later built the feature.<p>Doing this over millions of messages without sending everything to an LLM was the hard part initially. In ClickHouse, “fetch the last 50 events by time across conversations” and “fetch all events in this conversation” want different sort orders, so we had to iterate a lot on sorting keys, partitions, materialized views, and projections.<p>For finding new clusters, sending everything through an LLM was too slow and expensive. HDBSCAN-style embedding clustering also gets painful at scale because of pairwise comparisons. We first split conversations into segments based on cosine drift, run BIRCH to compress the candidate space, and then use HDBSCAN-like clustering on the smaller set. For matching existing clusters, we use embeddings, smaller classifiers&#x2F;BERT-style models, and LLMs only as fallback for ambiguous cases.<p>We’re live with multiple companies and ingesting ~1M chat and voice messages per day. Pricing is public: Starter is free, Pro is $499&#x2F;month, and Enterprise is for higher volume, security, retention needs. We use each customer’s data only for that customer. We are SOC 2 Type 1 compliant, Type 2 is in progress, and our SDKs are on PyPI and npm.<p>We’d love feedback from the HN community and people building chat or voice agents: how do you detect these signals today, what feedback methods hav
